<title> Assignment 3 </title>
<p>
	In browsing the webpages of my classmates from 2004, I saw many similarities and differences between the media sutdents used then and that they use now. One of the major similarities was that students then and now watch TV. However, while most TV watching today seems to be done via streaming services such as Netflix, they apparently actually used televisions back then (gasp). This is obviously because of the rise of streaming services that offer more options and more convenience for watching TV shows and movies. There also seems to be less consistency in the shows watched back then -- whereas now, everyone watches Game of Thrones, there isn't nearly as strong a trend in shows watched in 2004. I think this is because the rise of mobile device communication has meant that students now are more connected with each other, and streaming services mean that they can watch shows anytime instead of having to find a show that airs at a time everyone is free to watch.
	Video games were also played back in 2004. Back then, they were more often referred to as "computer games" than they are today, and once again, there seems to be less consistency in game choice than today, and video games seem to be less prominent than they are today. 
	It also seems like students today use a far greater percentage of digital media than in 2004. The students from 2004 mention books, magazines and newspapers more; nearly everything I saw on my current fellow students' pages can be accessed from a phone or laptop.
