	<h1>Tate Banks -- TAMU CSCE 445</h1>
	<p> This is my webpage for the 500 section of this class with Dr. Furuta.</p>
	<img src = "Me">
	
	<p> I am in this class because my interest in computer science is not necessarily the technical "what lines of code accomplish this" but more of "how can me and my team use this best", and one big application of computer science is in the area of media. </p>
		<p> Media I use every week include: </p>
		<p> -- Video games, mainly League of Legends and World of Warcraft</p>
				<p> -- Email, I am an involved student after all </p>
					<p> -- Netflix, when there's something new out </p>
					<p> -- YouTube, various different thing but mostly revolving around gaming and music </p>
					<p> -- Messaging apps, including texting and GroupMe, for both professional and casual purposes </p>
					<p> -- Telephone, several times a week </p>
