	In browsing the webpages of my classmates, I found many who use media in the same ways I do. The majority of my classmates use media for communication, including messaging, 
	telephone conversations, and, like <a href = "http://people.tamu.edu/~omer.fiazuddin/"> Omer Fiazuddin </a>, email. However, most cases of media usage that were mentioned 
	dealt with entertainment. Just about everyone watches Game of Thrones, and <a href = "https://hillwest36.wixsite.com/445assignment1/assignments"> Grant Hill </a> shares my enthusiasm for the Arrow and Flash TV shows.
	However, as <a href = "https://jacebkey.wordpress.com/"> Jace Key </a> points out, most of the TV shows watched by students are watched on streaming services, not on actual televisions.
	Video games, too, proved a popular shared interest. My most-played game, League of Legends, proved to be one of the more popular games, as several students, 
	including <a href = "https://github.tamu.edu/pages/heinjosh2323/CSCE445/"> Josh Hein </a>, play the game. 
	A few students shared my general motivations for taking CSCE 445, and I think <a href = "https://dunkleynathan.wixsite.com/csce445"> Nate Dunkley </a> put it best when he said he took it because it's one of the 
	more general courses offered in the department.
